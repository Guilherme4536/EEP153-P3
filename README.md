## Code Review Instructions:

Two main files to be reviewed include the Creating Nutritional Database and Ethiopia Demand and Utility Modelling. 

## Project Overview

This project examines the impact of the Tigray conflict on food prices and demand in Ethiopia. We aim to analyze price fluctuations before and after the conflict and assess how these changes influenced consumer demand for different food items. 

## Background

Ethiopia has faced significant challenges in recent years, including droughts, food shortages, political instability, and armed conflict. These factors have contributed to widespread food insecurity and economic instability.

## Key Events:

2015: A severe drought affected 10 million people, primarily in the eastern region.

Before 2020: Rising tensions between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed led to political unrest.

2020: TPLF forces attacked a federal military base and conducted their own elections, escalating conflict.

2022: The UN's World Food Programme reported that the conflict in northern Ethiopia had displaced hundreds of thousands and left more than 13 million people in need of humanitarian food assistance, particularly in Afar, Amhara, and Tigray.

Throughout Conflict: Both sides of the conflict engaged in strategies that worsened the food crisis, including diverting aid, destroying crops, and damaging infrastructure, exacerbating the effects of existing droughts.

August 2024: Food insecurity remains severe, with 15.8 million people still in need of assistance, and new conflicts emerging in Amhara and Oromia regions.

## Research Objectives

Food Price Analysis: Investigate changes in food prices before, during, and after the Tigray conflict.

Demand Fluctuations: Determine whether demand for specific food items increased or decreased as a result of the conflict.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Identification of food categories that experienced the highest price fluctuations.

2. Insights into shifting consumer behavior in response to food scarcity and price changes.

3. A clearer understanding of how conflict exacerbates food insecurity and disrupts markets.
